title:  "The Hardest Part"
---

Our first part of our team project was due on Thursday. I think it went pretty well. We didn't have to rush the last day because we started early, which is always great. The hardest part of the project was not the actual code as one might guess. It wasn't working as a team either. The hardest part is actually understanding what is expected of us and the different interpretations of the instructions. 

Although the project page is quite long, it does not have a lot of details and occasionally uses words like static and other vocabulary in awkward ways. The hardest part is clarifying the "project tech spec" or as close as a project of this nature can be to a traditional tech spec. In previous projects for this course, it was easy to know how the graders would grade a project. You knew what commands they would run and on what machines. You did not have to guess if they would have library x or y. This project introduces a lot more unknown variables. It is difficult and scary. One missed prediction and your grade could plummet. I definitely felt this pressure as team lead and as someone who could use every point possible on the projects since I don't do so hot on exams. 

Occasionally we would ask questions on Piazza, the responses would either be vague or not specific to our case. This makes things even harder. The only thing we found that worked the best was to either talk in person or ask early and keep following up until we were confident with the response and how it affected the project. 

> Tip of the Week:
> I may have said this before, but ASK QUESTIONS! Also, ask questions EARLY. It will not only help you, but it will help your fellow classmates. I really don't want to be the only one asking all the questions on Piazza.
