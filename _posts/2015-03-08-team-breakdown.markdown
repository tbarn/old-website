title:  "Week 7 - Breakdown of the Project Team"
---

I figured this would be a good place to document the progress of our project team, which I am leading for the first part of the project. We have mainly figured out what jobs there are, setup our Rackspace VM with user accounts for everyone, and started the API design. I broke up the jobs into three categories: Front-end, Docs, and API for this week and the next two weeks. 

Front-end will decide the layout of the website, research and decide what Javascript framework to use for making things like API calls and added Javascripty things (not sure what word to use there), and also implement the use of the API. 

Docs will work on the documentation of the API in Apiary. Originally I thought this might take two minds, but after looking at what was needed for our documentation and how few routes we have, it was decided by the team that only one person really needed to work on it. 

API will work on the actual Python implementation of the API, which will be three team members. One will focus on mining the information the API will return and then help the other two who are doing the implementation in the Flask framework.  

Docs and API team members will work on what the API routes are, what they will return, and what attributes they will contain, which will help the front-end decide the layout. We are trying to keep in mind what kind of information the front-end will need in order to be complete for each “pillar.”

Our three “pillars” are: Ingredients, Recipes, and Cuisines. Each will be linked to each other on the front-end and in some way also the API.

We will all contribute two pages to the report, which we will start after more code is written this week.

> Tip of the Week:
> Even if you study for days, code 100s of lines of practice code, a Software Engineering exam can destroy you, so figure out how to study right, whatever that is.
