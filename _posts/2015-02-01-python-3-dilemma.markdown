title:  "Week 2 and the Python 3 Dilemma"
---

It is now the second week of class and time to actually start working on the project. My first dilemma of the course didn't have anything to do with the actual code but instead where do I develop it on and where do I run it. 

The problem is, I have never used Python 3 at work nor for personal projects. I also have a recent track record of horrible buildout problems at work. One of was solved a couple of months ago by blowing away my Homebrew version of Python 2.7.9. 

[Disclaimer to what I am about to say: I am extremely lucky to have two laptops, and I am fully aware that what I am about to say might sound somewhat entitled.]

I have two laptops: One of them is slow, has 45 min battery at full charge, and is also used for work with version 2.7 at work. The other is a somewhat new, refurbished Mac Air that I promised myself I wouldn't code on so I could centralize all my code and development onto one machine. I could also ssh into the UTCS machines, but I would prefer to do my code in Sublime Text locally. 

The Result: I have decided to use a combination of the options. I am going to write my code on my Mac Air, push my code via git, and have a clone of the repo on the UTCS computers which I will ssh into to run in my local Terminal. 

Now you might think, “Taylor, this is not really a big deal.” After spending two days of work this summer unable to do any coding because of buildout issues, the scar is deep.
