title:  "It shouldn't take four years for students to look at a SQL query"
---

(Disclaimer: This is connected to CS 373 Software Engineering, but it is a bit more of on why students shouldn't wait so late to learn SQL and database technologies.)

This week I realized it took almost four years for me to look at a single SQL query in a course at UT. This is at no fault of the course, if anything, I'm thankful for it because of this being a part of curriculum. In addition, this course is not required to graduate similarly there is a database management course that is also not required to graduate. So basically you can graduate from UT as a Computer Science major and have never once looked at or programmed a database query. 

Now back to reality, what company isn't using a database? I understand that the traditional view of Computer Science is not to teach us the practical skills of our future careers, but instead teach us the fundamentals that help us learn the practical skills on our own or on the job. There's a lot of merit to this. But I feel many of our potential employers would love for us to have at least done some basic SQL before starting our full time jobs. It seems almost too basic to have not done in college.

So since we aren't required to take any course that includes SQL or databases in its curriculum, how do we get the exposure we deserve? Traditional CS curriculum in large universities isn't going to change any time soon, and this is definitely not a good enough reason for it to change in major ways. Students will have to step up and do it on their own (or take a course that includes it). I know personally I feared databases without any proper instruction. I feared them so much that most of the projects that I have done outside of class have avoided them entirely or had hack like solutions to avoid them while storing information in other ways.

So if you are not lucky enough, just do it. Find a simple tutorial and follow through the steps and then come up with a small project to try it out on more.

> Try to take useful courses in college (like CS 373 Software Engineering) because they will be a huge benefit that many of your peers will not have.
