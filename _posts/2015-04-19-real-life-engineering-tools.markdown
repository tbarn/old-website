title:  "Real Life Engineering Tools"
---

Last week in Software Engineering somehow continuous integration came up. I'm not entirely sure why but it did, and after my last job I got to know TravisCI and CircleCI a bit from when we were setting it up for our repos. I suggested TravisCI in class because it is free for public repos like our current projects. This turned into it being offered for extra credit. It appears most of the class is setting it up too so I want to try to make a list of things that I believe a student should look into while still in college and possibly during a course like this one. I'm going to call them, "Real Life Engineering Tools." I would not exactly call them all tools, but they help you do bigger and better things so they essentially are tools. 

Here's a few of them that I came up with tonight, in no way is this an exhaustive list:

* TravisCI, CircleCI, Codeship, or related hosted continuous integration services
* GitHub, especially pull requests
* Markdown
* Postman
* Runscope
* Slack, HipChat, or related modern chat services
* JIRA, Trello, or some kind of super charged issue tracking and project management software
* Pingdom or a related service to do website monitoring

> Tip of the Week:
> You don’t have to become an expert at any of these tools. If you can even say that you have used some of them a few times, an employer (probably if you are talking to someone from engineering) would be impressed. This is because so many college students as of lately are graduating without any experience with any “Real Life Engineering Tools.” Modern tech companies heavily rely on these types of tools.
