title:  "Hello World - First Week of Class"
---

I'm going to start off by saying how excited I am to be coding in Python in school. I've been waiting for this course for three years. I have three courses to graduate, and I finally got in. Now that I got that excitement out of the way... 

If you are reading this you either: 

* Already know me through some other means i.e. twitter, IRL, etc.
* Are a classmate
* Magically found this blog i.e. google, random link somewhere, etc.


This will be my course blog for CS 373, also known as Software Engineering. It is a Python based course that also uses databases and some front-end code. Luckily, I have working on all of those skills the past 8 months, except in databases. *(Did you know that you can graduate from UTCS without ever having to make a single database query?)* I am hopeful past knowledge will help me this semester. I will try my best to clearly communicate my thoughts in this blog, but occasionally I will throw together a post without going through it 4-5 times. 

Since I already know basic Python, the first few code examples we did in the first week were pretty easy for me. Though it made me think about two things:

1. I had to start remembering the differences between Python 2 and Python 3 since I am used to programming in Python 2.7. 
2. I was reminded that asserts are horrible for testing for users but great for testing as the programmer. They do not handle errors gracefully when a user is interacting with the code. 

I'm also going to include tips of the week from random other Python stuff I come across and things that helped me in this course or in a previous Downing course.


> Tip of the Week: 
> If you have never taken a course from Downing before, I highly suggest that you print out each class day's code before coming to class. I highly recommended it because it is almost impossible to listen to him, other students, and copy down the code at the same time with added notes. I learned this very quickly when I took his Object Oriented Programming course. I still missed things even with having the code on paper right in front of me. It really makes a difference when it comes to test time.


Until next week... I now have to go finish my [Hackcon](http://hackcon.io/) talk on Open Hackathon Data.
