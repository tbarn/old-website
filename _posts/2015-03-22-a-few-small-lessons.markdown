title:  "A Few Small Lessons and a Project Update"
---

It's time for another project update! Besides it being partially spring break, the hardest part of this week for me has been the stress of whether what we are doing project design wise is right or not. There was confusion early on what a “Flask model” really was after we had already mocked up our own way of storing information without a database. We are 70% sure we are doing it in an acceptable manner right now, but we will double check tomorrow before more unit tests are written and  port over the rest of the data our API will use. 

As the team lead, I felt the stress of possibly leading the team down the wrong path and feeling horrible for it. Luckily, everyone is on the same page and we talk about our design choices, so it makes it easier, but I still worry about it. 

We have a little less than four days left to work on it. If the way we did our “models” is allowed, we mainly will just have to finish up the front-end, write more unit tests, and finish the report, which has been divided up between the team. 

Since it was not required to call our own API, we decided to keep the first part of the project simple and use Jinja2 templating for Python. I've really enjoyed writing some almost pure HTML again. I have missed it. I worked on the templating inheritance between the different HTML page to eliminate repetitive code. 

> Tip of the Week: 
> If you have a question on a technical spec (or project description), ask it early. Although sometimes you don't realize you are confused about it later, try your best to ask as soon as possible because it can delay development.
