title:  "Extra Credit: Introduction to Web Development tutorial"
---

This year at [University of MAD](http://umad.me/) I gave a student lead workshop titled, "Introduction to Web Development with Python." From my experience, I had found that this could be best taught at a very introductory level with Python using the Flask framework. Although I wish I could have covered more material, it was well received since the very basics of how web applications work is rarely explained to students while in college. For the purposes of CS373: Software Engineering, we are well beyond this point, but I find that many students could possibly benefit from this existing in the future. Although my tutorial here is in the form of slides, I tried to make them easy to follow along. When I gave it at uMAD, I occasionally stopped to answer questions and help people follow along in a setup on [Nitrous.io](https://nitrous.io/). I found that this made it easier for students not have to setup their local machines and be able to be up and running much quicker. Nitrous.io even already comes with many needed Python packages when you choose a Python setup.

Find the slides [here](http://taylorbar.net/uMAD_Intro_to_Web_Dev.pdf). It is very introductory and a work in progress, but if you have any feedback about the slides, please let me know!
