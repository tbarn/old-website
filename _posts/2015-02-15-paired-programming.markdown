title:  "Week 4 and Thoughts on Paired Programming"
---

One of the pieces of required reading this week was a piece I had read in a past course. It is called, ["All I Really Need to Know about Pair Programming I Learned In Kindergarten"](http://www2.yk.psu.edu/~sg3/cmpbd205/assign/week01/ACMarticlePairProgramming.pdf). At the time, I had not really done a whole lot of paired programming so I had not seen why it was such a great piece on the topic. Now, I see that it is an great paper that anyone who does any pair programming should read. 

I wanted to touch on two lessons I found critical after having done some paired programming the last two years. First piece of advice: Flush. When you and a partner work independently it is critical to flush the independent work down the drain. I have had partners work without me ( and occasionally against my own desire). When I looked at the code after some lines had been written, I found it twice as hard to understand it and even harder to find bugs in it. You have to flush independent code down the drain and restart where ever you left off with your partner. There is nothing wrong about working on possible solutions on your own, but it is critical you walk back through those solutions with your partner while pair programming. It makes things more difficult for both of you in the long run. 

Second piece of advice that I found critical: Share everything. Just like in any great relationship you can’t be selfish. Although you are two people, you are working together to create the same piece of code. There is no “you don’t understand” a piece of code or “you don’t know the answer.” It is all about “we.”

> Don’t fall behind on studying for quizzes. (I should probably listen to my own advice. This week my positive z score took a little dip into negative z score range. Time to study more!)
