title:  "The Last Stage of the Project is Done"
---

This week in Software Engineering we completed our last stage of the project. Yay! Now that it is done, I figured I'd look back to comment on what I wished we could have done differently. In no way is this putting blame on anyone, these are just things that could have made the code cleaner, better designed, or added complexity to help us learn a new technology. 

I really wished we could have used a front end framework. There's only so much time so I understand our decision not to, but I think it could have been a better learning experience as well as better separate the front end from the back end. It would have required a substantial amount of work though, since all of us have never done anything like it before from the ground up. Some of the ones I was looking at were AngularJS and React. 

There are functions that could have been written better. One example of this was the search function. I was responsible for it and I have never written a search function before, so it was my first try at it. I did not know how to properly query the database for AND and OR results in an efficient manner and the code got a little ugly. Some parts of the search method could have been properly broken up into helper function as well as done completely differently. (I don't know what way differently though.)

With a bit more practice, we could have definitely designed our individual pillar pages better. Since we thought the requirement was to have a lot of information on them, we just kind of threw a bunch of things at them in the form of text and embedded HTML from other sites.

> For this project, don't feel pressured to use a front end framework. It is not required, but you should seriously consider what your personal goals are for the class and what you might learn from implementing it.
