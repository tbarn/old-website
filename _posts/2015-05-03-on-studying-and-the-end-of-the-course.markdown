title:  "On studying and the end of the course"
---

I really don't know what to write about for this last class blog. I've hit the point where when it comes to writing on a specific topic, like how to do well in CS 373: Software Engineering, my brain wants to write everything besides that. Maybe it is because I have been trying to study Capital Budgeting for my Finance exam on Wednesday or maybe it is because I have had a lot of thoughts going through my head coming up on my last week of my undergraduate career (and maybe college forever). 

There were a few things I wish I could have done differently in Software Engineering. First, I wish I wrote different code to study for the first exam. I wrote code to study for the exam, which is great! But it was nothing like the code that I had to write out on the exam. I was doomed from the start.

Second, when studying for daily quizzes, I needed to focus a little better. I did study for almost every quiz. I am very proud of this, but I think maybe my brain was all over the place because when it came to some of the simple answers like what is the name of the movie that one article talks about... I blanked out. I had seen the movie two or three times and still could not remember the name. I had read the article twice and still could not remember the name. I could remember names of similar documentaries and could even remember the faces of people in it and where they worked. I'm just thankful that when a situation like this comes up in the real world, our phones aren't usually too far away from us. (Oh how the world has changed...)

I wish I spent more time in the class practicing SQL and running the code; because, studying this week is going to be a lot harder now. I focused on a lot of the Python back end for the class project and was told what queries to do. This made my life easier, but also it gave me less experience with SQL queries, an area I wish I dedicated more time to in college. 

Well, it has been stressful and swell. That's all folks. Hook'em!

> Tip of the Week:
> When though you might be studying until you are completely exhausted, try to have a bit of fun every once in awhile.



P.S. I wrote most of these blogs very tired and only read over each once before publishing. I hope no one will hold that against me.
